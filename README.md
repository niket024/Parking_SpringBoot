# Parking_SpringBoot
Design a parking lot using object-oriented principles (Encapsulation, Design patterns etc).  1) The parking lot has multiple levels. Each level has multiple rows of spots. 2) The parking lot can park motorcycles, cars. 3) The parking lot has motorcycle spots, compact spots. 4) A motorcycle can park in any spot. 5) A car can park in a single compact spot. 6) If a level is full or capacity more than 80%, the other level should be allowed for parking. 7) At any point of time, we should be able to know the number of motorcycles and cars / vehicles in altogether parked.  Please create APIs/URIs of your preference to access the apps and get the metrics. (using Springboot)
